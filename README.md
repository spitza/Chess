This is chess in the terminal. It's meant for two human players to play, head-to-head.
There is no computer opponent. Written in Python 3.

To run in your terminal:
`python3 main.py`

The game will then kick off a series of prompts until complete.

Oddly, the fully white pieces (top of the board) are "Black" pieces in unicode.
The pieces that have no fill (bottom of the board) are "White".

To exit the game early, type `control-c`.
